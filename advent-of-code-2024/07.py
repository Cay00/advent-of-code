# Each line represents a single equation. The test value appears before the colon on each line;
# it is your job to determine whether the remaining numbers can be combined with operators to produce the test value.

# Operators are always evaluated left-to-right, not according to precedence rules.
# Furthermore, numbers in the equations cannot be rearranged. Glancing into the jungle,
# you can see elephants holding two different types of operators: add (+) and multiply (*).

#   For example:

#   190: 10 19
#   3267: 81 40 27
#   83: 17 5
#   156: 15 6
#   7290: 6 8 6 15
#   161011: 16 10 13
#   192: 17 8 14
#   21037: 9 7 18 13
#   292: 11 6 16 20

#   test answer 1: 3749
